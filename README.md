## Development Environment Setup
This will detail the simplest set of steps on how to get the development environment set up to starting developing.
A more detailed guide, with some alternatives, can be found here: https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation.

### PHP
Download and install PHP, version 5.6.4 or greater.
Note: PHP also comes with a prepacked environments like WAMP or XAMPP, which can be used instead.

Next, ensure the windows PATH variable includes a reference to the PHP install location (e.g. ..\wamp64\bin\php\php7.0.0).

### Composer
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP, like npm for javascript.
Download and install Composer from: https://getcomposer.org/download/.

### Laravel
To install Laravel, enter `composer global require "laravel/installer"` into the command line.

### Developing with PHP and Laravel
With all the dependencies set up, clone the repository to suitable location and begin coding.

The project can be run using PHP's built-in server 'Artisan' by entering `php artisan serve` into the command line while in the project folder.
